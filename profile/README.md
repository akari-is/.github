## Akari.is
We are an audio company focusing on making interfaces for non-professional use.

Our plan is to make the software available by the end of 25 and hardware by the end of 26 as a fair and cheap competition to other such related products.

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

**If your reading this you like to stalk.** There will be 2 thing that we will release. The hardware will be called akari.hw and the software will be called akari.so;
